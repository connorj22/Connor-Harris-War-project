# Game of war

This project we had to code a the card game war using java script. 

THe rules are below: Two players evenly split a shuffled deck of 52 standard playing cards. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them. The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

Players take turns playing the top card from their stacks. Whoever's card is a higher value puts both cards at the bottom of their stack.

If there is a tie, then it's War! Each player adds three cards of their stack face down. Each player reveals their fourth card. Whoever wins that reveal takes all of the cards! If there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

## Running the game

To run the test simply load the file and run the code, everything should appear in your console. 

### Sample Game

To start the console will log both decks. Then the console should show the cards played each round and who won the round. The first card logged is from deck1. If their is a war, the console will log all the cards in the war. Finally once their is a winner the console will log their deck and declare which deck was the winner.
